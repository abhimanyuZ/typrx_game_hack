A game hack!

A small JS script to hack typing speed based games on <b><a href="http://app.typrx.com/">TyprX</a></b>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Copy the code in **hack.js** file
<li>Open <a href="http://app.typrx.com/">TyprX</a> in your browser
<li>Click on either of the buttons "Compete in a race" or "Practice alone" ("Compete in a race" is kinda more fun)
<li>You'll be taken to another page where countdown will start
<li>Open browser console window ASAP (google it if you don't know how to do that)
<li>Paste the code and hit enter key as soon as the countdown is gone 
</ol>

**That's it**
You will see your typing speed like 200wpm or more , slaying all the contestants. xD

Hope you enjoy it :)
